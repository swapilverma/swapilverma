## Hi there 👋


👋 Hi there! I'm **Swapil Verma** — an IIT Kanpur grad 🎓 and aspiring Data Scientist who finds joy in solving real-world problems with code, caffeine, and curiosity ☕💡.

💻 From slicing data with Python 🐍 to storytelling with Power BI 📊, I love transforming raw information into insights that actually make sense (and sometimes even impress my mom).

🚀 I build projects around Machine Learning, NLP, and dashboards — and I’m always tinkering with new ideas that blend logic and creativity to make data *do the talking*.

📚 Currently learning Gen AI and experimenting with model tracking using MLflow. Next stop? Making AI less buzzword, more backbone.

📍Based in Bangalore, powered by watermelon 🍉 and motivation — let's connect the data dots one repo at a time!
